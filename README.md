# NewSlant: Identifying Political Slant in News and Understanding Influence on Readers

Abstractâ€”Political news is often slanted toward its publisher's ideology and seeks to influence readers by focusing on selected aspects of contentious social and political issues. We investigate political slants in news and their influence on readers by analyzing election-related news and reader reactions to the news on Twitter. To this end, we collected election-related news from six major US news publishers who covered the 2020 US presidential elections. We computed each publisher's political slant based on the favorability of its news toward the two major parties' presidential candidates. We found that the election-related news coverage shows signs of political slant both in news headlines and on Twitter. The difference in news coverage of the two candidates between the left-leaning (LEFT) and right-leaning (RIGHT) news publishers is statistically significant. The effect size is larger for the news on Twitter than for headlines. And, news on Twitter expresses stronger sentiments than the headlines. We identified moral foundations in reader reactions to the news on Twitter based on Moral Foundation Theory. Moral foundations in readers' reactions to LEFT and RIGHT differ statistically significantly, though the effects are small. Further, these shifts in moral foundations differ across social and political issues. User engagement on Twitter is higher for RIGHT than for LEFT. We posit that an improved understanding of slant and influence can enable better ways to combat online political polarization.

## Reproducing the results

Download the dataset and unzip under the '_dataset/_' folder.
You can download the dataset from [IEEE-DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/newsslant). 
For more details about the dataset read the README file under the '_dataset/_' folder.
The dataset files already contain the sentiment towards the two Presidential candidate in news headlines and Tweets, as well as moral foundation scores for user response. The results can be directly produced from these. If you wish to produce these scores, the repository includes code to reproduce these scores as well.
